								<h2>Why Risk Management</h2>
								<p>Managing risk within an organization is one of the key responsibilities in ensuring the protection of assets and valuable business information. Risk management is done by identifying, assessing, and treating existing risks to enable greater confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its tangible and intangible assets. </p>
								<p>Tangible assets include things that one can touch, like computers, cash, and stock. Intangible assets include items that lack physical substance like patents, trade secrets, employment contracts, and databases. All of these assets must be protected from unauthorized individuals. This is why risk management is imperative in identifying, assessing, and treating any risks that place assets in harm's way.</p>
								<h2>Risk Response Techniques</h2>
								<h3>Avoid</h3>
								<p>An entity can avoid risk by merely not partaking in any risky activity. An organization must evaluate their company's level of acceptable risk. Based on this, they can determine whether they should avoid a specific task and pursue a different option. For example, an organization may have two application options--Application A and Application B-- they consider purchasing. Application A has excellent value but requires many open and vulnerable ports, making it extremely risky. Therefore, to avoid risk, the company pursues Application B with a more secure firewall with many closed ports.</p>
								<h3>Transfer</h3>
								<p>Since risk can be transferred or shared instead of single-handedly absorbed, an organization may choose to transfer the risk to another entity, to reduce impact ultimately. Seeking insurance or moving the risk to a third party to handle risky activity are common methods.</p>
								<h3>Mitigate</h3>
								<p>An organization may also choose to mitigate or reduce the impact of risk by implementing specific controls within their infrastructure. Up-to-date antivirus, antimalware software, patching up the operating systems, and ensuring the latest signatures are methods to mitigate malware risk.</p>
								<h3>Accept</h3>
								<p>It is impossible to eliminate every possible risk. When the cost of control is greater than a risk, the entity will most likely accept the risk. For example, spending $75 on a mounted lock to secure a $10 keyboard would not make sense. Therefore, the entity accepts the risk of having the keyboard stolen.</p>
								<h2>Risk Assessment</h2>
								<p>Risk assessment, also known as risk analysis, is a critical element of risk management. The first step to risk assessment is identifying assets and asset values. Mainly, risk analysis quantifies or qualifies risks based on various values. An asset value determines the worth of the asset to the organization. These values can be categorized on a monetary or subjective level, such as low, medium, and high. Identifying asset values is an essential step since organizations can focus on high-value assets rather than exhausting time on low-value assets.</p>
								<p>Following identifying asset values, an organization will pinpoint threats and vulnerabilities, calculating a threat's possibility to exploit a vulnerability. Risk analysis seeks to discover the impact of potential threats and determine the likelihood of the incident. Additionally, the task of completing a risk analysis will typically conclude with suggestions as to what controls will best mitigate risk.</p>
								<p>Risk assessments are commonly executed before an entity pursues a specific new application or service to be implemented within their business. This critical step is to be taken to ensure that the potential gains will offset the potential risks before finalizing the pursuit of a new asset. Risk assessments are calculated using quantitative measurements or qualitative measurements. Quantitative measurements utilize objective and numeric figures like monetary values expressing cost and asset values. Furthermore, qualitative measurements utilize judgments and are based on the subjective measure.</p>
								<h2>Quantitative Risk Assessment</h2>
								<p>Quantitative risk assessment quantifies the risk using a specific monetary value. By assigning a quantitative value to a particular asset, the organization can prioritize high-value assets over low-value assets based on its monetary value. For instance, an entity can better utilize its resources and time, focusing on managing a $100,000 piece of hardware equipment over a $45 keyboard.</p>
								<p>Understanding the asset value is critical in quantitative risk assessment. Asset values may include revenue amounts or replacement amounts of an asset. For example, an application may generate $20,000 in revenue for the company. However, if the application fails, it will cost the company $20,000 in lost revenue plus the amount to repair and patch the problem.</p>
								<p>A typical model used in qualitative modeling uses single loss expectancy(SLE), annual rate of occurrence(ARO), and annual loss expectancy(ALE) to determine risk. Specifically, single loss expectancy(SLE) is the cost of any single loss. The annual rate of occurrence(ARO) describes how many times a loss will occur in a year. Finally, the annual loss expectancy(ALE) is the amount of SLE*ARO.</p>
								<p>Let's take the example of company headphones. The value of each headphone is $45, so the SLE is $45. Employees lose about one headphone a month, so the ARO is 12. The company headphones' annual loss expectancy(ALE) can be calculated as SLE*ARO, so $45*12=$540.</p>
								<h2>Qualitative Risk Assessment</h2>
								<p>Qualitative risk assessment utilizes judgment to calculate and categorize risk based on the probability or likelihood of occurrence. The possibility of occurrence is the probability that a threat will exploit a vulnerability. Unlike quantitative risk assessment, qualitative risk assessment is based on a subjective level that utilizes judgment to assess risk.</p>
								<p>Many qualitative risk assessments make use of surveys as a way to canvas responses. These surveys will typically require its respondents to respond with ratings from a subjective standpoint. For instance, respondents may be asked to rate the probability of a specific risk as low, medium, or high. Additionally, it is common to categorize and assign low, medium, or high to numbers like 1,5, and 10, respectively.</p>
								<p>Because qualitative risk assessment is solely based on judgment, it can be challenging to be entirely confident concerning its calculation accuracy. Unlike quantitative risk assessment based on monetary values that can be validated with facts, qualitative risk assessment may be subject to debate or uncertainty since it is based on probability.</p>

									<h2>What is Social Engineering

								<h3>Social Engineering</h3>
                                <p>Do you recall a movie where a con artist successfully manipulates his/her victim into performing something the victim would not normally do? Do you remember a moment in your own life where you received a scam call or email? Perhaps it was a credit card scam, lottery scams, or a phone call from someone claiming to be the IRS demanding a large sum of money. Why are these fraudulent schemes so successful? Why do cybercriminals thrive in this environment, or why do victims fall into the trap of these scams?</p>
							    <p>Whether the scam artist was successful or not, every single fraudulent undertaking involves social engineering. Regarding information security, social engineering is the psychological practice that uses social strategies to gain and collect confidential information. Successful social engineering manipulates and tricks people into actions they would not normally do, like providing security credentials to strangers. Social engineers generally utilize different social tactics like impersonation to build credibility or incite fear, which forces victims to fall on their knees and submit to the scammer's desire.</p>
                                <p>Social engineering can be executed in various ways; attacks can be delivered in person, through emails, phone, or while using the internet.</p>
                                <p>Recently in my own experience, I received a fraudulent text message in which I almost fell victim to. This specific sender of the text message claimed to be AT&T, my phone service provider, and notified me of an unsuccessful payment that was made.</p>
                                <center><img src="images/WhatisSE2.jpg"></center>
                                <p>Initially, I was quite terrified concerning this matter because an unsuccessful phone bill payment may strip me of my phone service rights. Out of fear, I was about to call that number in hopes of quickly resolving this issue. However, looking a little deeper into the text, I began sensing the presence of a scam. I couldn't help but notice the caller ID. I knew this was not an automated, verified message from AT&T due to the existence of an area code but rather from a scammer. Indeed, on the part of the scammer, it was a well-executed social engineering scheme that impersonated AT&T that developed an ostensibly realistic notification. Fortunately, I did not fall into the trap that the social engineer cleverly designed after building reservations about the caller ID.</p>

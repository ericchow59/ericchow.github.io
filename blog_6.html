								<h3>Impersonation</h3>
                                <p>Frequently, social engineers impersonate a legitimate person or entity when carrying out their attacks. By doing so, they disguise and equip themselves with credibility when interacting with others to heighten their chances of manipulating people of their information. For example, suppose a social engineer was to undertake an attack in a residential neighborhood. In that case, they may disguise themselves as water and power technicians to gain entry into houses, opening up many opportunities for an attack.</p>
                                <p>One of my favorite examples of impersonation comes from the iconic "Home Alone" movie. The crook, named Harry, disguises himself as a police officer and goes house to house, giving each resident a "talk" about the prevalence of burglaries around the neighborhood during the Christmas season. What he is doing is attempting to seek out information as to when the family may be out of town, the type of security controls within the home like automated lights, and the level of security alarm sophistication. This is a prime example in which criminals use social engineering, specifically impersonation, to exploit the victim's trust to gather information before they make an attack.</p>
                                <h3>Shoulder Surfing</h3>
                                <p>Another prominent tactic that social engineers use to gain information is shoulder surfing. While this tactic is in-person, it does not require communication between the attacker and the victim. By merely using casual observation, attackers can look over their shoulders towards a victim's computer screen or automatic teller machines(ATMs) to learn sensitive credentials like username, passwords, PINs, social security numbers, and banking information.</p>
                                <h3>Tailgating</h3>
                                <p>One of the biggest challenges an attacker has is lacking access credentials to a secure environment like a building or room. Therefore, many attackers exploit tailgating. Tailgating exists when an attacker follows an authorized employee into a building without showing any credentials. Typically, it is common courtesy to keep the door open for others to enter, which is why attackers find it relatively easy to slip into a building without needing any verified identification.</p>
                                <h3>Phishing</h3>
                                <p>Phishing is a social engineering tactic in which attackers send emails to users with the intent to trick them into clicking on a malicious link or providing sensitive information to them. For example, attackers may replicate a Bank of America website in which they send as a link in the form of an email to various users claiming they need to log into their account for verification reasons. A successful phishing attack will result in users clicking inputting their security credentials onto this malicious Bank of America site in which the attackers spoofed. To add on, various malware could be additionally installed onto the user's system due to clicking on the link.</p>
                                <h3>Spear Phishing</h3>
                                <p>Spear phishing is a phishing attack in which the attacker targets a particular group of people or a specific person rather than the general public. Commonly, attackers will impersonate themselves as high executives within an organization like a CEO. Using the CEO's title and authority in an email, these attacks pressure and coerce employees with a lower position within the entity to provide security credentials or business information for malicious intent or competition.</p>
                                <h3>Vishing = "Voice Phishing."</h3>
                                <p>Unlike phishing, which utilizes the internet and email, vishing is when attackers use the phone systems to gain information. Voice over IP(VoIP) is a commonly used technology that executes many of these vishing attacks. VoIP can spoof the caller ID when delivering calls, making it seem like the call is from a legitimate company or entity.</p>
                                <p>Vishing may appear in a machine automated recording or a simple cold call from a criminal. These automated calls or cold calls may contain a message relaying the urgency for victims to provide sensitive information to avoid threats and danger. For example, these calls may have questions regarding one's identity or banking information, ultimately searching to collect information that attackers may use in the future.</p>

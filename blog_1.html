								<p>Keeping private information and data secure nowadays in this digital world is a real challenge with everyone, including businesses, social media platforms, and hospitals collecting, storing, and sharing information. Sensitive information like Social Security, credit card or bank account information, employee records, or trade secrets is personal or private business information that is all susceptible to risks if data is not securely protected.</p>
								<p>The CIA Triad is a security assurance model that businesses and organizations use to facilitate information security. You might be thinking about the CIA, the Central Intelligence Agency? However, the CIA triad has no association with the well respected governmental agency. Instead, the abbreviation stands for:  <br />
									*Confidentiality: Keeping private information or data confidential by inhibiting unauthorized access  <br />
									*Integrity: Ensuring data is protected from unwanted and unauthorized alterations  <br />
									*Availability: Making sure data, information, and services are available only to authorized users
								</p>
								<h2>Confidentiality
									</h2>
								<p>Ensuring confidentiality is one of the core principles of any organization or business that collects and stores private information. Consider this example with a medial center. Patients and clients expect private and sensitive information collected by the medical staff like physical checkup results or health updates to be kept confidential. A violation of confidentiality occurs if the medical center shares sensitive details with other medical providers or insurance. Another example of confidentiality exists where e-commerce websites are expected to keep confidential customer private information like credit card information, addresses, phone numbers protected.
								</p>
								<p>Confidentiality can be breached in multiple ways, both intentional and unintentional. For instance, information collected from clients shared with third parties without the client’s consent is a form of breach of confidentiality. In many cases, the sharing of data frequently stems from the desire to do business and leveraging private information for profits. However, violation of privacy can result from unintentional actions due to existing vulnerabilities and security flaws that enable unauthorized entry.
								</p>
								<p>Some common threats to confidentiality include encryption cracking, eavesdropping attacks, and man-in-the-middle attacks. To promote greater confidentiality, security mechanisms like strong passwords, multi-factor authentications, encryption, and action control lists(ACL) should be implemented. Each business must assess the magnitude of its risks to understand the level of security measures that need to be incorporated within the organization to prevent a breach of confidentiality.
								</p>
								<h2>Integrity
									</h2>
								<p>The main objective of maintaining integrity is ensuring the validity and reliability of the information. Confidentiality and integrity go hand in hand: information cannot be changed or altered if it wasn’t accessed in the first place. Retake the medical center example. The health data collected from patients are expected to be accurate and verifiable. A breach of integrity exists when the information attached to a patient is altered and modified.
								</p>
								<p>Oftentimes, breach of integrity is done for personal or financial gain from individuals or groups. Changes to business data or records are done to influence the business courses of action. Alternatively, modifications to business stock portfolios may be done to increase public perception, thus boosting financial gain. However, auditing, encryptions, digital signatures, and intrusion detection systems are mediums to protect information integrity.
								</p>
								<p>Specific settings and rules embed in different operating systems enable the integrity of data among users. Only specified or host users can modify settings and data to ensure the integrity of changes. For example, on macOS, specific security settings like the Firevault and Firewall can only be changed by specified or host users with access via username and password.
								</p>

								<h2>Availability
									</h2>
								<p>The readily available access to data and information to authorized individuals is referred to as availability. Computer networks, data, and information add no value if they are not easily obtainable to be utilized by authorized individuals. Therefore, businesses actively ensure the reliability of assets and systems to promote information to individuals that facilitate business processes. Take the medical center example once more. Doctors and nurses need to have patient records and data readily available to diagnose and conduct health checks. If computer systems that hold these records are down, doctors cannot do their jobs, placing their patients' lives in danger.
								</p>
								<p>A common problem that threatens the availability of information to legitimate users is a distributed denial-of-service attack, also known as a DDoS attack. This attack involves overwhelming a service or network to drown Internet traffic, effectively disabling availability and depleting system performances and services. However, organizations can prevent and overcome DDoS attacks by purchasing more bandwidth, building redundancy within the infrastructure, protecting the DNS server, or deploying anti-DDoS hardware and software.

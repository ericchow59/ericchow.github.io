								<h3>VPN = “Virtual Private Network.”</h3>
                                <p>One of the largest concerns with telecommunications over the public network is the risk of the man-in-the-middle, spoofing, or eavesdropping attacks. Attackers can easily spoof their MAC or IP address and insert themselves in between network traffic between the client’s system and the server. This becomes a matter of concern because once a hacker gains access to one’s network traffic, they can intercept, redirect, or steal information being communicated from the user’s device to the server. A virtual private network, or commonly referred to as VPN, is a method used to provide security and encryption for data transfer. A VPN allows users to gain remote access to a private network through a public network.</p>
                                <h3>How does a VPN work?</h3>
                                <p>On simple terms, a VPN creates a tunnel that uses encryption that safeguards a user’s data when it is transferred to the Internet. Think of a VPN as a massive barrier or wall separating your data from hackers or the government. When a user first connects to a VPN, their data becomes encoded, which means it is translated into an encrypted form until it reaches its destination. As a result, all data and traffic flowing through the open-air become unreadable and unreachable by virtually anybody attempting to do harm. Once the data reaches its final destination, the information becomes decrypted to be processed and executed.</p>
                               <center><img src="images/WhatisVPN2.jpg"></center>
                                <h3>Why use a VPN?</h3>
                                <p>A prime example where VPNs are especially critical exists when making an online transaction or submitting personal documents on the web. Once a user hits the “Submit Payment,” all that information(billing address and credit card information) is sent through the public network where it is vulnerable to interception. However, with a VPN, all the information and data becomes encrypted and made unreadable until it is successfully delivered to the final destination.</p>
							    <p>Data transmission over the Internet happens at an incredible pace. With the increased utilization of the Internet, we transmit very sensitive information across the web quite frequently. Without a VPN, it can be said that the user is shouting credit card information or their social security numbers into the air. This is why information security and VPNs are such an essential facet of using the web. Countless attacks and theft of information are being executed countlessly every day.</p>

								<h3>Viruses</h3>
								<p>Viruses are among the most commonly known types of malware. This type of malicious software replicates itself by altering different computer programs after executing a specific program. Once the host application runs, the virus activates and performs its task. Mostly, the task of a virus is detrimental to a system. Worst case scenario, viruses can delete files, enable backdoors for future attacks, or completely take over the system commands. A virus will slow down the system performance in a less harmful scenario, clogging a server's bandwidth and memory to complete tasks.</p>
								<h3>Worms</h3>
								<p>Worms are self-replicating malware that infects a network without the presence of a host application or user intervention. They are a form of a virus capable of modifying and deleting files from a system. Additionally, worms utilize various protocols to travel to different parts of a network. Worst of all, because of its self-replicating nature, the strength in numbers can significantly deplete system resources.</p>
								<h3>Trojans</h3>
								<p>Trojans, also known as a Trojan horse, impersonates legitimate software, but in reality, is malicious. This software may come in the form of a game, a functional utility, or something that seems attractive enough to be downloaded. Due to the enticing persona a Trojan presents, users are often tricked into downloading these Trojans that ultimately infect their systems.</p>
								<p>It is prevalent for cyber attackers to distribute Trojans via drive-by downloads. Once attackers compromise a website with malicious code, they deliver these sites to a wide range of individuals, with the intent that users would visit the compromised site. Once users visits, the website attempts to download the Trojan onto the user's system. Another commonly used Trojan method is rogueware or scareware. Rogueware impersonates free antivirus software. Once a user visits a particular site, an alert message or pop-up stating the detection of damaging malware on the user's device will appear on the screen. After that, the user is encouraged to download the free antivirus software, which, in reality, holds the malicious Trojan.</p>
								<h3>RAT</h3>
								<p>RAT, also known as a remote access Trojan, is a malware type that provides attackers control over systems from remote locations. Like a regular Trojan, a RAT delivery comes via a drive-by download or fake antivirus software. After RATs are downloaded into a system, they can automatically receive and track keystrokes, email traffic, and security credentials like usernames and passwords. Additionally, attackers have absolute control over a user's device and can download additional malware in the future if desired.</p>
								<h3>Adware</h3>
								<p>Adware is a software type that is created with the primary intent of generating revenue. Developers have learned to exploit installation processes by incorporating adware as a way of creating more income. Frequent cases of adware are evident in pop-up ads on websites and advertisements. The effects of adware may frequently be more of an annoyance issue rather than a threatening one. Because pop-up ads require a substantial amount of bandwidth, network performance may be dampened as a result.</p>
								<h3>Ransomware</h3>
								<p>Ransomware is a form of Trojan that confiscates data from a user's control and seeks absolute control over the device. These can be significantly terrifying because attackers will demand a ransom to be paid to regain administrative commands over the device. Ransomware that involves the encryption of the user's data is known as crypto-malware. A prominent real-life example was evident in the WannaCry ransomware attack, caused by the WannaCry worm, in May of 2017. It resulted in over 200,000 victims with over 300,00 computers infected. The primary targets were computers running Microsoft Windows. Data was encrypted to demand ransom payout in the form of Bitcoin cryptocurrency.</p>
								<h3>Spyware and Keyloggers</h3>
								<p>Spyware is malicious software downloaded onto a user's system without the user's awareness or authorization. The main goal of spyware is to monitor and gather sensitive information on a personal or corporate level. Confidentiality is immediately lost once spyware is installed since it accesses a user's private data, which is stored or sent to a third party for additional harm. However, spyware is equipped to redirect a web browser or install other malicious software within the browser. Furthermore, attackers can take absolute control over a user's system with the existence of spyware.</p>
								<p>A common tool of spyware are keyloggers, which seek to capture each user's keystrokes. Keyloggers can vary in complexity. Some can manually collect security credentials like username and password on a specific site on a single basis. More complex ones have the ability to automatically collect and send keystrokes of a user's device to a stored database for the attacker's future reference.</p>
